            <h2>Here is a little bit about cheese</h2>
            <p>Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.</p>
            <p>Cheese is valued for its portability, long shelf life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese lasts depends on the type of cheese. The wide range of flavors and textures of cheese results from the complex interactions of the milk's biochemical composition, the bacteria and mold involved in cheesemaking, the processing conditions, and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents.</p>
