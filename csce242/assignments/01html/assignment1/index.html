        <h3>Metal Gear</h3>
        <p>Hideo Kojimahas been making video games since the late 1980s with his very first game "Metal Gear". Metal Gear(MG) was, at the time, an innovation to the stealth genre with mechanics that hadnt been seen before, and would develop into an entire franchise. Metal Gear 2 was released in 1990 and was an all around improvement from the previous installment. After Meat Gear 2 was released fans would have to wait for 8-11 years, based on where they lived, for a continuation of the series with Meatl Gear Solid(MGS) which was the first 3D game in the francise and would set the standard for the rest of it. MGS is the game where the stealth gameplay formula and storytelling of the francise began to take shape.</p>

        <h3>Hojima Productions/Depth Stranding</h3>
        <p>Kojima would later work on games up until 2015 after the release of MGS5 after a falling out between him and his parent company Konami. Kojima would then go on to create his own game development studio "Kojima Productions". After 4 Years of development time Kojima would finally release a game from his new Studio titled "Depth Stranding". Depth Stranding(DS) is vastely different than many of Kojima's other games because the pacing of the story is much slower, having the player walk long distances and complete other objectives before the story continued. Among fans this game has a love-hate relationship, either you really love it or despise it for it slower gameplay. The last game kojima has released was the sequel to Depth Standing, Depth Stranding 2:On the Beach, which released June of 2025 and had a much better reception from fans than the first installment.</p>
